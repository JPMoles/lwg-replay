  <h2 >» 4.7 Balance patch (April 9, 2022)</h3>
  
  Welcome to the long awaited balance patch!
  <br>
  <br>
  This patch sees many balance changes mostly at improving general design and strategy diversity, but with an overall  nerf to mechanical play. Many players have complained that mechanical play is too strong, and mech vs mech is the most common matchup in high level play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most significant nerf to mech play is a reduction to worker repair rate which will severely hamper some worker assited mech pushes, and the common defense where a single mech unit (aided by half a dozen workers) will heroically defend a small army on it's own.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition we are bringing back the iconic werewolf smash ability, giving werewolves an attack speed decrease to compensate. It's a cool ability and it's nice to have cool abilities in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  We will be monitoring (and playing!) the game after these changes, and if anything feels too strong or weak there will be future changes to adjust.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <img width="48" height="60" src="imgs/emotes/worker.gif" align="left">
  <h3 style="margin-left: 65px; margin-top: 30px" >» General</h3>
  <ul class="changelogList">
      <li>Repair Rate reduced from 12.5 to 9</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Multiple workers repairing a single mechanical unit could often repair faster than a small force of enemy units, removing the vulnerability of undefended units
      </blockquote>
      <li>Bird vision increase from 9 to 10</li>
      <li>Bird cost reduced from 100 to 75 gold</li>
      <li>Bird acceleration increased from 0.03 to 0.05</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Birds are quite fragile and easily fly into enemy fire, meaning they are rarely used. By giving birds more agility and vision they should stay alive for longer, and with the cost reduction we hope to see them more often in early game play.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Airship health reduced from 300 to 250</li>
      <li>Airship size reduced by 20%</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Long ago we deliberately made airships overpowered to encourage their use. Airships are cheap, fast, easy to tech to, and very durable. <br>Now airships are used almost every high level game and feel too strong. A health decrease should make a player think twice before diving a drop into a tower or other defenses. Also they looked stupidly big.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Attack and defence upgrades for each faction initial cost increased from 140 to 150 gold (from 125 gold for mechanical)</li>
      <li>All upgrades cost increment decreased from 60 to 50 gold</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Having upgrades in increments of 50 makes them easier to remember e.g Level 3 will now cost 250 instead of 260 gold and level 4 will cost 300 instead of 320 gold.<br>
          This will also increase the chance that players get both level 5 upgrades, which rarely happens.

  <img width="64" height="64" src="imgs/emotes/soldier.png" align="left">
  <h3 style="margin-left: 81px; margin-top: 32px" >» Human</h3>
  <ul class="changelogList">
      <li>Soldier cost reduced from 85 to 80 gold</li>
      <li>Archer cost reduced from 85 to 80 gold</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: In barracks play we see a dominance of raider openings, with early soldier and archer play rarely seen. We hope this change will allow more variation in openings for rax players, in addition to giving the faction a small boost in general.</li>
      </blockquote>
      <li>Shroud casting range increased from 5 to 6</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: It can be quite difficult to get good shrouds off, especially once archer range has been researched. </li>

      <li>Werewolves regain their iconic smash ability</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Smashy smashy
      </blockquote>
      <li>Dragons lairs no longer require a wolves den</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: It is not intuitive that a dragons lair should require a wolves den, and there is already the fort requirement.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Wolf sprint fast duration increased from 5 to 8 seconds</li>
      <li>Wolf sprint slow duration decreased from 10 to 5 seconds</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Currently using wolf sprint has quite a small benefit with perhaps and even larger downside with the slowdown, these large buffs should increase it's utility.

  <h3 style="margin-left: 81px; margin-top: 32px">» Mechanical</h3>
  <ul class="changelogList">
      <li>Gatling Caltrop slow duration reduced from 7 to 5 seconds</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Seven seconds is quite long and can be frustrating to deal with. This change should keep caltrop's utility when catching units with nearby forces to kill them, while reducing the annoyance when running into a caltrop randomly somewhere in the map.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Gatling gun armor penetration increased from 0 to 5</li>
      <li>Gatling gun damage reduced from 14 to 13</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Gatling guns fill a "sort of good against everything" role. These change makes it more of a specalist unit, allowing players on either side more counter options.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Gatling gun cargo use reduced from 4 to 2</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Only being able to fit two gatling guns into an airship makes gatling gun drops very ineffective, increasing to four per dropship should bring gatling drops more in line with the power of drops for other units.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Catapult attack upgrades increment decreased from 5 to 3</li>
      <li>Gatling gun attack upgrades increment increase from 1 to 2</li>
      <li>Gyrocraft attack upgrades increment increase from 1 to 2</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Many players are familiar with the lategame catapult deathball which can feel imposible to defeat. By reducing catapult's attack upgrade scaling and increasing  for other mechanical units we hope to see less catapult-heavy lategame armies.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Ballista attack upgrades increment decreased from 6 to 4</li>
      <li>Ballista defence upgrades increment increase from 1 to 1.5</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Lategame ballistas are often extemely powerful versus air units, but only if they get the opportunity to shoot them. At the same time, as attack upgrades for other units scale, ballistas become increasingly vulnerable to ground forces.<br>
          These upgrade changes should make ballistas a bit more well rounded in the lategame, promote micro where ballistas can be used as a shield for other units, and with the airship health nerf still allow airships a chance vs ballitas.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Note: 0.5 armor has no effect against whole number damage, but 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 obviously will. This means that level 1 armor will still get 1 extra armor, but level 2 will give 2 extra armor.
      </blockquote>
      <li>Workshop cost decreased from 150 to 125 gold</li>
      <blockquote class="developerNote">
          Reason: Workshop openings have a hard time against raider openers, and the nerfs worker repair speed and to base gatling gun damage certainly won't help with this. Reducing workshop cost and allowing the first workshop to finish earlier should help get that first and second gatling gun out earlier to fend off raiders.

  <h2 class="changelogHeading">» Overview</h2>
  For the past few years, the Ranked game mode has featured a number of <a href="#" class="changelogLink" data-target="newUnits">new units</a>, but these were not available on regular maps, adding an unnecessary barrier to entry and confusion for newer players. We are very happy to announce that these units are finally coming to the base game! For a full discussion of how this affects existing maps, continue reading <a href="#" class="changelogLink" data-target="frozenMapFeature">below</a>.<br><br>
  
  Additionally, there have been a large number of bug fixes, both <a href="#" class="changelogLink" data-target="majorBugs">major</a> and <a href="#" class="changelogLink" data-target="minorBugs">minor</a>, as well as a fair amount of internal code cleanup, which is vital to continue pushing out new features. More excitingly, some <a href="#" class="changelogLink" data-target="newFeatures">highly-requested features</a> have been added, and much more is planned for the future.<br><br>
  
  Finally, as some of you may already know, I (glaba) have become the primary developer of Littlewargame. I am committed to improving this game, increasing the player count, and most importantly, taking community input and remaining transparent. A huge thanks as well to silverboss and Aicy, who have helped with development, and to the countless others who have helped by giving suggestions, testing, and encouragement.
  
  <h2 class="changelogHeading">» Balance Changes</h2>
  
  There have been a significant number of balance changes from Version 4.2. For those of you who play the Ranked mode, you will already be familiar with these changes in the form of the AA4 maps. For those who are not, the following is a quick summary of the most significant changes to existing units and buildings:
  
  <ul class="changelogList">
      <li>The HP, armor, health regeneration, and damage of all units and buildings have doubled, to allow for greater granularity when balancing</li>
      <li>The starting gold amount has been reduced from 300 to 50</li>
      <li>The supply cap has been increased from 100 to 150</li>
      <li>All speed and range upgrades have been removed, replaced by the Range Upgrade for Archers, and the Sprint ability for Wolves</li>
      <li>Dragons cost significantly less gold and supply, and are correspondingly weaker in HP and damage</li>
      <li>The damage and HP of the Worker have been reduced to encourage aggression</li>

  <h2 class="changelogHeading jumpTarget" id="newFeatures">» New Features</h2>
  
  A number of features have been added as a part of Version 4.3. The following is a comprehensive list of all the newly added features:
  
  <ul class="changelogList">
      <li><span class="featureName">Replay Window</span>: The Load Replay button has been replaced with the Replays button, which opens a window where replays of recently played games are autosaved. These replays are saved to your computer and not your account, so clearing browser data will delete all autosaved replays. Replays can still be loaded and saved to your computer as before. Expect this feature to see more UI improvements in upcoming patches.</li>
      <li><span class="featureName jumpTarget" id="frozenMapFeature">Frozen map files</span>: Mapmakers no longer need to worry about updates breaking their custom gameplay! Mapmakers now have the option to "freeze" their map files, saving all custom unit data and graphics such that any updates to the base game will not affect their map's gameplay. Many maps have automatically been converted to frozen map files as part of the upgrade to Version 4.3. Note that freezing a map file is irreversible, so if your map was automatically frozen and you would like for it to change with the base game instead, please contact a moderator or admin to help restore your map.</li>
      <li><span class="featureName">Symmetric map editing</span>: A long-awaited feature, symmetric editing is finally available in the editor. Mapmakers have a choice of five modes: no mirroring, horizontal mirroring, vertical mirroring, diagonal mirroring, and four-way mirroring. When a symmetric map editing mode is active, any change to the map will automatically be mirrored according to the chosen mode in real-time.</li>
      <li><span class="featureName">Editor image previews</span>: Many graphics fields in the editor now show image previews to simplify the process of setting graphics coordinates.</li>
      <li><span class="featureName">Custom aura color and ability cursors</span>: Formerly, healing ward and slow field were hard-coded to have a green and blue aura color, and mapmakers who wanted custom aura colors were short of luck. Similarly, ability cursors were also hard-coded and could not be set manually. Now, custom aura colors and cursors can be set by mapmakers.</li>
      <li><span class="featureName">Map compression</span>: Map files are now compressed while being loaded, which should lead to slightly better load times for those with poor Internet connections.</li>
  </ul>
